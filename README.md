# ReadMe.com - Portfolio Project

## 1. Introduction

ReadMe aims to connect parents who want to find, borrow, purchase, or trade books for their children to read, creating a community that promotes a love for reading, cooperation, and equity. By leveraging technology and the collective resources of parents, ReadMe provides a convenient and affordable solution for accessing a wide variety of resources and children's books.

### Problems:
- Limited access to diverse children's books for parents, particularly those in underserved communities.
- Difficulty finding suitable books for children within their age range, cultural backgrounds, and diverse interests.
- High costs associated with purchasing new books, creating an affordability barrier for many families.
- Unequal access to resources and opportunities for children from marginalized communities.

### Goals:
- Promote equitable access to a wide variety of children's books for all parents, regardless of their socio-economic status or geographical location.
- Ensure representation and inclusivity by providing a diverse collection of books that reflect different cultures, languages, and experiences.
- Reduce financial barriers by facilitating borrowing, purchasing, and trading of books, making reading materials more affordable for all families.
- Bridge the digital divide by offering an accessible and user-friendly platform that accommodates different devices and internet connectivity levels.
- Empower parents from marginalized communities to actively participate in their children's reading journey and foster a love for reading.

### Value:
- Create a level playing field by providing equitable access to diverse children's books, helping to close the literacy gap.
- The site offers a wide range of books that represent different cultures, languages, and perspectives, promoting understanding and empathy.
- By enabling borrowing, purchasing, and trading, ReadMe reduces financial barriers and ensures access to books for families with limited resources.
- ReadMe encourages parents from all backgrounds to actively engage in their children's reading development, fostering a sense of community and shared learning.
- By providing access to a rich collection of books, ReadMe empowers children from underserved communities to explore new worlds and expand their knowledge.

## 2. What the MVP of your Project will Look Like

The minimal viable product would be a web application that allows parents to create accounts, search for children's books based on age range, and genre. It would include a user-friendly interface for browsing and discovering books and a profile management system for users to add books to their personal libraries.

## 3. Prioritized List of Extra Features

- Connect with other parents in their district or school for borrowing, purchasing, or trading books.
- Communication feature to facilitate book exchanges between parents.
- Purchase books from 3rd party locations (e.g., Amazon, Target, etc).
- School or District to upload their required reading lists or access to school library database.

## 4. Market Survey

Similar sites to ReadMe all have capabilities to search for books by age, genre, or topic but are not community or school district based, are only in English, and require purchasing books from their site.
